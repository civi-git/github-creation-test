## CS197 Analysis

### Problem
Traditional scientific discovery is limited by human cognitive bandwidth and requires extensive manual coordination across research phases. Existing AI systems only assist with isolated tasks rather than automating the complete research lifecycle from ideation to publication.

### Prior Assumptions
- Scientific research requires human oversight and coordination across all phases
- AI systems can only assist with narrow tasks like brainstorming or coding
- Full automation of research would compromise scientific rigor and novelty
- Peer review requires human judgment and cannot be automated effectively

### Key Insight
The complete scientific process can be automated by chaining frontier LLMs across the research lifecycle: idea generation → code implementation → experimentation → analysis → manuscript writing → peer review.

### Technical Approach
- **Idea Generation:** LLM generates novel research directions within constrained domains
- **Code Implementation:** Automated coding to implement experimental setups
- **Execution:** Automatic experiment running with result collection
- **Analysis:** Automated data analysis and visualization
- **Writing:** Full paper generation including figures and citations
- **Review:** Automated peer review system for quality assessment

### Evaluation
- Applied to three ML subfields: diffusion models, transformers, learning dynamics
- Cost: ~$15 per complete paper
- Automated reviewer achieved near-human performance on paper evaluation
- Generated papers exceeded acceptance threshold at top ML conferences

### Impact
- **Bit Flip:** From "AI assists human researchers" to "AI conducts autonomous research"
- Democratizes research by lowering cost barriers
- Enables rapid exploration of research spaces
- Challenges traditional notions of scientific authorship and peer review

### Research Gaps Identified
- Limited to computational domains (no wet lab integration)
- Relies on human-authored code templates
- No iterative improvement based on review feedback
- Single-agent approach limits collaborative potential

### Key Assumptions This Work Makes
- Template-based research is sufficient for novel contributions
- Quality can be maintained without human oversight in the loop
- Peer review can be accurately simulated by LLMs
