## CS197 Analysis

### Problem
Scientific discovery requires integration of literature search, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis, but no system had previously automated all these stages in a single workflow for experimental biology.

### Prior Assumptions
- Wet lab experimentation cannot be integrated with computational research systems
- Multi-agent coordination introduces too much complexity for reliable research
- Biological hypothesis generation requires domain expertise beyond current AI
- Scientific discovery in biology requires extensive human oversight

### Key Insight
Multi-agent systems can integrate literature search agents with data analysis agents to achieve semi-autonomous biological research, including novel therapeutic discovery.

### Technical Approach
- **Literature Search Agents:** Systematic background research and knowledge synthesis
- **Data Analysis Agents:** Automated interpretation of experimental results
- **Hypothesis Generation:** Iterative hypothesis formation and refinement
- **Experimental Integration:** Lab-in-the-loop framework for biological validation

### Evaluation
- Identified novel treatment for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD)
- Discovered ripasudil (ROCK inhibitor) as therapeutic candidate
- Validated therapeutic hypothesis through follow-up RNA-seq experiments
- Revealed ABCA1 upregulation as novel therapeutic mechanism

### Impact
- **Bit Flip:** From "computational-only autonomous research" to "wet lab integrated autonomous discovery"
- First AI system to discover and validate novel therapeutic in iterative framework
- Establishes paradigm for AI-driven biomedical research
- Demonstrates autonomous research capability in high-stakes domains

### Research Gaps Identified
- Scalability to diverse biological research domains
- Integration with complex multi-step experimental protocols
- Quality control for high-consequence therapeutic discoveries
- Regulatory and ethical frameworks for AI-discovered therapeutics

### Key Assumptions This Work Makes
- Multi-agent coordination can maintain research reliability
- Literature-based hypothesis generation is sufficient for biological research
- Lab-in-the-loop validation provides adequate experimental rigor
